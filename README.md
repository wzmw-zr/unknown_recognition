# This is a repository for unknown task recognition.

## TODO-list
- [x] Base class for anomal detectors.
- [x] Base class for anomal datasets.
- [x] Data preprocessing pipeline.
- [x] Simple MLP classifier with cross entropy loss function (Baseline).
- [x] Fix parameters-mismatch problems in some components' interfaces.
- [x] Try different normalization to generate logits data (logits generated by different models have different range).
- [x] Add test cases for datasets.
- [x] Add test cases for anomal detectors.
- [x] Try different input features for anomal detectors.
- [x] Add normalization layers for anomal detectors.
- [ ] Add necessary comments.
- [ ] Support several ML classification algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc...
