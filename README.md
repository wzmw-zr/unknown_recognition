# This is a repository for unknown task recognition.

## TODO-list
- [x] Base class for anomal detectors.
- [x] Base class for anomal datasets.
- [x] Data preprocessing pipeline.
- [x] Simple MLP classifier with cross entropy loss function (Baseline).
- [ ] Fix parameters-mismatch problems in some components' interfaces.
- [ ] Try different normalization to generate logit data (global min-max normalization cannot work well if logit is generated by different models).
- [ ] Add test cases for datasets.
- [ ] Add test cases for anomal detectors.
- [ ] Add necessary comments.
- [ ] Support several ML classification algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc...
